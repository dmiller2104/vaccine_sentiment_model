# Vaccine sentiment model
This project is about the refinement of a vaccine sentiment model I developed as part of my dissertation project.

The vaccine sentiment model aims to classify Tweets into four categories:
- Category 1 :  Not relevant or an article headline connected to a link
- Category 2 : Vaccine hesitant
- Category 3 : Anti-vaccination / negative sentiment towards vaccines
- Category 4 : Pro-vaccination / positive sentiment towards vaccines

At the moment the model currently achieves an accuracy around 60 - 63%. I am looking to improve on this.
